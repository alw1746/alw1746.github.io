# Environment:

## I am a software developer with the following setup.

- a Raspberry Pi 5 computer with a 1024x600 touchscreen display, keyboard,mouse.
- the computer runs bookworm OS with the latest updates applied.
- a directory named "media" which has 4 subdirectories:
  * Cars
  * Motorcycles
  * Planes
  * Ships
- the subdirectories contain a number of image files for each category of vehicle.

# Task:

## Write a Python application using kivy GUI framework to display images of vehicles based on their category.
- Use swipe gestures or mouse on the touchscreen for navigation.
- image files are located under the media directory.

# Context:
## The program logic is as follows.

- create a main window with title "Transport Vehicles".
- add label "Main Menu" centered at the top of window.
- add 4 buttons distributed evenly in window labelled as "Cars","Motorcycles","Planes","Ships".
- for each subdirectory under "media", get all file names and store them in a list named after its category. Sort the list in alphbatical order .
- on button click of a vehicle category, display a new window with 2 vertical panes:
  * Display pane
    - 80% of window height for displaying images.
  * Instruction pane
    - 20% of window height for displaying user information.
- display the first image of the selected list in the display pane. Scroll through the list using the following gestures:
  - swipe or mouse-drag left to display next image in list.
  - swipe or mouse-drag right to display previous image in list.
  - swipe or mouse-drag up to return to "Main Menu".
- the instruction pane contain the following information:
  * left side: a left arrow icon with label "Next"
  * right side: a right arrow icon with label "Previous".
  * center: an up arrow icon with label "Main Menu".

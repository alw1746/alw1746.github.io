The PAM8403 is a cheap 3W <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-D_amplifier>Class-D audio amplifier</a> chip typically found in USB speakers. Powered by 5V, it offers low distortion,
and being more efficient than Class-AB design, is well-suited for portable applications. A breakout board is available for
$1 on ebay. For more details on the chip, see the <a href=pam8403.pdf>PAM8403 datasheet</a>. 
<br><br>
The board is a tiny 2cm x 2cm.

Schematic of my circuit. Note the inclusion of a pot to vary the brightness of the power led. The pot was initially used 
to cover the hole after the volume pot was drilled in the wrong spot by mistake. But upon reflection, why waste a perfectly 
good pot doing nothing? So the world's first amp with a variable power led was born. Brilliant!

Closeup of the PAM8304 module soldered on a PCB. The module does not use normal 2.54mm pin spacing which is a bit
annoying. But I found 22AWG solid-core wire fits perfectly into the plastic spacer from a 0.1 inch header, thus effectively a diy header with bendable legs.

Bottom view of the PCB. I had to glue the 3.5mm line-in socket to the wall of the case, no easy way of mounting it.
<a href=selleys.png>Selleys All Plastic Fix</a> is the best glue for this.

Back view of the amplifier. By then, I realised the box was upside down and after some teeth-gnashing, flipped it by
rotating the power switch and knobs. Had to live with an inverted power led.

Have a listen to the music and watch the power led being adjusted. How cool is that!

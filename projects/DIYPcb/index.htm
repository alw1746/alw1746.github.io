<div class="indented">
I'm experimenting with making a PCB using the photoresist method after some disappointing results with toner transfer. My schematic is a temperature
controller shown below:<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
The board image is:<br><br><br>

The UV exposure box is still not finished but the tubes are usable. Driving them with 4 CFL starters.<br><br>

<br><br><br>
The first try had an exposure of 90sec and the resulting board after developing looked like this. Ooops!<br><br>

<br><br><br>
The second try had an exposure of 14mins and the resulting board after developing looked like this. Not that great either.<br><br>

<br><br><br>
Oh well, I'll have to keep trying with different times till I get it right. Maybe I'll reconsider the toner transfer method.
